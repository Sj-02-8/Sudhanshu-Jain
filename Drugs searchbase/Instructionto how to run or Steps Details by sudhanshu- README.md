1) First we need to download node.js and visual studio set up the React project by Creating a folder with any name and opening CMD in that folder:


   Inside the CMD we write command :
   
                                    - npx create-react-app app-name
   
                                    - cd app-name

Then you have to install dependencies. which is important for this project. Without it this will not work. To Install it type cmmand :

                                    - npm install react-router-dom axios
				        - npm install react-spinners


	 
then to start visual execute this:       

                                     - code . 
   
   SS:

Once did executed :  
                    
		     - code .  

We will see something like this

....................................................................................# IMPORTANT NOTE #................................................................................................................. 

AFTER CREATING YOUR REACT PROJECT, YOU ONLY HAVE TO REPLACE YOUR FILES UNDER SRC FOLDER and PUBLIC FOLDER WITH THE ONCES I HAVE UPLOADED HERE WHICH CONTAINS THE MAIN CODE WRITTEN BY ME. EVERYTHING ELSE WILL BE THERE IN YOUR REACT ENVIRNMENT EXCEPT FOR SRC FOLDER FILES. WE CANNOT UPLOAD 800 FILES ON GIT IT IS NOT ALLOWED SO ONLY MAIN CODE IS UPLOADED.

.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


2)After you have this open you need to make and rearrange files accordingly. Now we will create folders and files like this as mentioned below but main folder under which we will write our code is src folder. Under src folder there will be two more folders Components and pages. Explained as follows:


     -src/
 
     -components/
     		
   		-- DrugList.js
   	 	-- DrugDetail.js
            -- SearchBar.js
     
    
      -pages/
      
   	 	-- SearchPage.js
   	 	-- DrugDetailPage.js
   
    -- App.js
    -- index.js
    -- api.js
    -- styles.css

For the scenario we were give files would look like this. Can compare it with above folder heirarchy:-

3) Now Code all the files accordingly
4) After writting code start npm to see your app changes by executing command:
 
                                                                           - npm start

6)  And push it to the git by doing the following:

        -git add *
     
        -Git status or git status –uno to check the added calls status( what are deleted , modified or unstaged)
   
        -Git outgoing  – if (there is something outgoing)
    
                     		then do git commit  --amend
                     		(give ID and title)
                     		do -git submit
    
                        else-if(want to do fresh git transfer && something is there in git outgoing)
                        	then do git reset HEAD~2(depending on no.)
	                   	then do git commit and give JIRA ID and title
                     		then GIT SUBMIT  
               		else
	  			just do git commit JIRA ID and title
	                  	GIT SUBMIT save the link
